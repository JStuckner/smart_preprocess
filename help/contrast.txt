LEVEL BALANCE

Scales the data to increase the apparent contrast for display purposes.  
This should be done last.

Clip:
Clips the data to the input value times the standard deviation of the data.
Lower numbers will lead to more clipping.  Setting a negative value will
clip the data to the minimum and maximum values.
