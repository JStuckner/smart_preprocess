CHAMBOLLE DENOISING

Removes noise from the dataset by reducing the variation within the images
while preserving edges in the original image.

Weight: 
Higher weight removes more noise but causes more blurring. Lower weight
removes less noise but preserves the original image better.

Stacks:
How many frames are allowed to be stacked together.  Must be an odd integer.
Setting this to a negative value allows unlimited stacking (usually 5 or so
frames for a weight of 0.1).
