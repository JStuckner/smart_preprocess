GAUSSIAN STACK

Stacks the frames in a "moving weighted average" sort of way where the
weight of each frame is determened by a gaussian distribution with a 
standard deviation of sigma.  Frames that are further away are weighted
less heavily.

Sigma:
The standard deviation of the Gaussian kernal (units of frames).  A larger 
number leads to more stacking.
